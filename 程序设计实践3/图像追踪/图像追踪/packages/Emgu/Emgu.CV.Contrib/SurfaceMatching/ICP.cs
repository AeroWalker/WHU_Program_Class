    /// <summary>
    /// This class implements a very efficient and robust variant of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The task is to register a 3D model (or point cloud) against a set of noisy target data. The variants are put together by myself after certain tests. The task is to be able to match partial, noisy point clouds in cluttered scenes, quickly. You will find that my emphasis is on the performance, while retaining the accuracy.
