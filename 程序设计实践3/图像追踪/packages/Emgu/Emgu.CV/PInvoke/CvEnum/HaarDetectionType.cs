If the flag is set, the function does not look for candidates of a smaller size as soon as it has found the object (with enough neighbor candidates) at the current scale. Typically, when min_neighbors is fixed, the mode yields less accurate (a bit larger) object rectangle than the regular single-object mode (flags=CV_HAAR_FIND_BIGGEST_OBJECT), but it is much faster, up to an order of magnitude. A greater value of min_neighbors may be specified to improve the accuracy
